<h1>CSC 321/Design and Analysis of Algorithms<br />Homework 5</h1>
<h2>Due: Friday, February 24th, 11:59pm CT</h2>
<hr />
<h2>Implement quick sort (30 points)</h2>
<p>
Using the pseudocode in the textbook as a guide, implement <strong>in Java</strong> (yes, this time you must use Java) the randomized quick sort algorithm as a method.  You will also, of course, need to implement the methods it relies on.
</p>
<p>
Write a main method that:
<ol>
<li>generates an array of length 100,000 with integer values randomly generated between -10<sup>6</sup> and 10<sup>6</sup>
<li>records the start time in milliseconds
<li>calls quick sort
<li>records the end time and computes and prints the time the sort took to complete
<li>records the start time in milliseconds
<li>calls quick sort a second time on the same array, which is now sorted
<li>records the end time and computes and prints the time that call to the sort took to complete
</ol>
You should see two similar times.  If the second time is larger, you're probably not implementing the randomized partition algorithm correctly
</p>
<h2>Implement a find median algorithm (20 points)</h2>
<p>
Using the pseudocode algorithm presented in class on February 20th, implement a linear-time algorithm <strong>in Java</strong> for finding the median of an array.  Once again, write a main method that generates an array in the same way as requested in the previous program to test your median-finding method.
</p>
<h2>Extra credit: The Bucket Challenge (10 points)</h2>
<p>
You have a bucket holding 1 liter of water.  Every hour, you remove half of the remaining water.  In hours, how long will it take you to empty the bucket?
</p>
<h2>Submission instructions</h2>
<p>
Create one zip file containing both Java source files and submit that zip file into the homework 5 drop box.
